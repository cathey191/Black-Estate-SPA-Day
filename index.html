				<h3>Our Aim</h3>
				<p>Weâ€™re set on making our wines true to the place they grow. The winemaking is simple - good estate grown fruit, organic &amp; biodynamic, handpicked, vineyard derived yeasts, no additives or fining, minimal sulphur at bottling and where possible, no filtration. Then we have character.</p>
